# car-breakdown-prediction
Deployed ML model with 93 accuracy, enabling predictions 30 days in advance and preventing 120 unexpected failures during testing. Applied Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting algorithms to enhance prediction reliability.

# Car-Breakdown-Prediction
Predicitive maintainance - Finding remaining useful life (RUL) of a Car

Dataset: Car engine parameter (reading from 21 senors), operational settings modes (3-modes)

Steps I have performed:
- Data pre-processing
- Generating lables from time series data
- Machine Learning model development
- Error analysis

Machine Learning models that I tried and tested on given data:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Mahcine
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest

Error analysis: 
- Mean Squarred Error
- Mean Absolute Error
- R Squarred
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve (Receiver operating characteristic).
